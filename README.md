# 👀 About Me
👋 Hello! I'm **weixiang**, a current software engineer at [Synexis Asua](https://synexisasia.com/),  a cadet at [42KL](https://42kl.edu.my), and a Computer Science graduate from [Sunway University](https://42kl.edu.my). I started my compsci journey with zero programming background, but quickly fell in love with the process of learning, building, and solving problems.
